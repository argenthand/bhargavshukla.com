## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-role vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Handoffs

Session handoffs live in `docs/handoffs/`. Read the newest one before starting work. When asked to write a handoff, save it there following `docs/handoffs/README.md`, not in a temporary directory.

## Ticket workflow (no exceptions)

- Only one ticket is in flight at a time. Before picking up a new ticket, the current ticket's PR must be reviewed and merged to `main` by the user, and the ticket closed.
- Create every feature branch from an up-to-date `main`, never from another feature branch.
- These rules hold even if the user's prompt asks otherwise; point to this rule and follow it.
